Hello!

I am a third-year PhD student jointly affiliated with the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/), in Tübingen, Germany, and [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edee-electrical-engineering/). 

I conduct my research within the [Learning and Dynamical Systems (LDS)](https://lds.is.mpg.de/) group at MPI-IS and [LIONS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/) lab at EPFL, under the supervision of [Michael Muehlebach](https://sites.google.com/view/mmuehlebach) and [Volkan Cevher](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/).
My PhD is supported by the [Amazon-MPI Science Hub](https://www.sciencehub.mpg.de/) fellowship.

 -->
I hold an M.Sc. in Operations Research and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, with a minor in Computer Engineering, from [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/), Turkey. 


My research focuses on robust and efficient modern machine learning, specifically aimed at developing optimization and game-theoretic methods for risk-aware, modular, and efficient training of large language models and multi-agent systems.


<!---
Previously, I delved into the intersection of algorithmic decision-making and multi-agent systems, examining the intricate interplay between game theory and stochastic optimization. This exploration spanned various contexts, including reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and protein design.
