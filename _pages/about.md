Hello!

I am a first-year Ph.D. in Computer Science student at the [CS@max planck](https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/) program. I work in the [Multi-agent Systems](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gradanovic/group.html) research group at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. 

I received my M.Sc. in Operations Research and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering with a minor degree in Computer Engineering at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/). 

My research interests include artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and stochastic optimization, specifically: reinforcement learning.

%Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
%
%Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
%
%Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
