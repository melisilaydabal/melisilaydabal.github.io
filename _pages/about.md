Hello!

I am a second-year PhD candidate at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, and a doctoral fellow through the [Amazon-MPI Science Hub](https://www.sciencehub.mpg.de/). 

I am co-advised by [Michael Muehlebach](https://sites.google.com/view/mmuehlebach) and [Volkan Cevher](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/).

I hold an M.Sc. in Operations Research and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, with a minor in Computer Engineering, from [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/). 

My research focuses on optimization for machine learning, specifically aimed at developing techniques that enhance the robustness and training efficiency of machine learning models.
Previously, I delved into the intersection of algorithmic decision-making and multi-agent systems, examining the intricate interplay between game theory and stochastic optimization. This exploration spanned various contexts, including reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and protein design.
