Hello!

I am a second-year Ph.D. in Computer Science candidate at the [CS@max planck](https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/) program and a doctoral fellow through [Amazon-MPI Science Hub](https://www.sciencehub.mpg.de/). I work as a doctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), TÃ¼bingen, Germany--in the [Learning and Dynamical Systems](https://lds.is.mpg.de/) research group.

I received my M.Sc. in Operations Research and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering with a minor degree in Computer Engineering at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/). 


My research interests encompass algorithmic decision-making and multi-agent systems. Within these domains, I am particularly fascinated by the intricate interplay of game theory and stochastic optimization. Previously, I have focused on the intersection of these, in the contexts of reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization.
