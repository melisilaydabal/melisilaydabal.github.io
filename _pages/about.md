Hello!

I am a first-year Ph.D. in Computer Science student at the [CS@max planck](https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/) program. I work in the [Multi-agent Systems](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gradanovic/group.html) research group at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), Saarbr√ºcken, Germany. 

I received my M.Sc. in Operations Research and B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering with a minor degree in Computer Engineering at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/). 

My research interests include artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, and stochastic optimization, specifically: reinforcement learning.
